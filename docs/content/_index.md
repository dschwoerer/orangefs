#### OrangeFS
OrangeFS, a scale-out network file system designed for use on high-end computing (HEC) systems that provides very high-performance access to multi-server-based disk storage, in parallel. The OrangeFS server and client are user-level code, making them very easy to install and manage. OrangeFS has optimized MPI-IO support for parallel and distributed applications, and it is leveraged in production installations and used as a research platform for distributed and parallel storage.

OrangeFS is now part of the Linux kernel as of version 4.6.  As this version of the kernel becomes widely available, it will simplify the use of parallel storage by Linux applications through OrangeFS.
